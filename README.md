# OpenJDKPatchUpdatesSchedule

A very trivial tool to check the when an OpenJDK patch update can be expected (or has been likely released!). No guarantees this is exact though, use at your own risk, this software may autodestruct your machine or become self aware at 2:14 a.m.!

Usage:

## Method one

$ javac Main.java
$ java Main.java 2022

## Method two

Use jbang :) [https://www.jbang.dev/]

$ jbang Main.java 2022
